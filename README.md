# linear-and-binary-search
The purpose of this project is to show the difference between binary and linear searches.
I used 4 functions. These are linearSearch, binarySearch, generateRandomSortedArray, printArray.
generateRandomSortedArray function is for generating a random and ordered sequence of integers within the framework of certain rules.
printArray function is for writing the resulting array.
linearSearch function is for searching as linear.
binarySearch function is for searching as binary.
